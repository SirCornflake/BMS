The following files are as follows:

1. "function.R": A R script that contains all the necesary functions to perform estimation and model selection in Linear, Logistic, Negative-Binomial, Quantile, and Skew-Normal regression.

2. "Model Ilustrations.R": A R script that can be used to illustrateo all five regression models. “summary_gibbs” function provides the posterior mean of parameters, and quantile 2.5% and 97.5%, alongside the explored models with their respective proportion of times that was selected.

	b) Fit the models
	c) Run Table estimation, credible interval plot, and prediction plot to replicate the Manuscript tables and plots

4. "ens.csv": A "csv" file that contains the data set used in the "Application Code.R" file
